 ## Healthcare Data Analysis and Insights

The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data daily, providing valuable insights for
healthcare providers and policymakers to improve patient care, allocate resources effectively,
and manage healthcare costs. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive healthcare dataset
comprising medical examinations, hospitalization details, and customer profiles to extract
insights into patient health profiles, medical histories, and healthcare costs. By exploring
relationships between various health metrics, identifying trends, and visualizing key patterns,
we aim to deliver actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders for informed decision-making
through rigorous data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and analysis.
